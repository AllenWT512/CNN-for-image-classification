# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification

Study Objectives：
1. Understand the CIFAR10 dataset
2. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Master the model construction process
4. Implement a training function
5. Implement a prediction function

In this section, we will use the knowledge we’ve learned so far to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to perform image classification. 

To complete this case study, the following concepts will be covered:
1. Understanding the CIFAR10 dataset
2. Building the Convolutional Neural Network
3. Writing the training function
4. Writing the prediction function
