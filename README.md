# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-for-image-classification
Case Study - Image Classification
Learning Objectives
Understand the CIFAR10 dataset
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Master the model construction process
Implement a training function
Implement a prediction function
In this section, we will use the knowledge weâ€™ve learned so far to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to perform image classification. To complete this case study, the following concepts will be covered:

Understanding the CIFAR10 dataset
Building the Convolutional Neural Network
Writing the training function
Writing the prediction function
